# 🧠 Machine Learning Notes & Practical Implementations

Welcome to my **Machine Learning Repository** — a complete collection of my learning journey in **Machine Learning**, covering both **theory (PDF notes)** and **hands-on practicals**.  
This repo is designed for anyone who wants to **learn ML from scratch to advanced level** — with clear explanations, code implementations, and structured topics.

## 📘 What's Inside

### 🧾 Notes
Detailed and easy-to-understand **PDF notes** on:
- Machine Learning fundamentals  
- Types of ML (Supervised, Unsupervised, Reinforcement)  
- Important Algorithms & Concepts  
- Probability, Statistics & Linear Algebra for ML  
- Feature Engineering & Model Evaluation  
- Deep Learning (Basics + Advanced Topics)

### 💻 Practicals
Fully coded implementations with explanations for:
- Regression & Classification Models  
- Decision Trees, Random Forests, SVM  
- Naive Bayes, KNN, Logistic Regression  
- Clustering (K-Means, Hierarchical, DBSCAN)
